# Shift Management Application

## What will the application do?

This application automatically generates a weekly shift schedule when arranging work shifts by inputting employee's available working hours, positions, and other information. This eliminates the need for manual calculations that can be time-consuming and error-prone. It includes the following features:

- **Creating shift schedules** based on available working hours.
- Distributing **employees in the same position at different times** (e.g., not scheduling Supervisors at the same time, but on different days within the week).
- Equally distributing employees with **varying levels of job experience** (to avoid having all newcomers, for example).
## Who will use it?
Especially, **store manegers** who manage shifts for employees.

## Why is this project of interest to you?

I have a friend who is a nurse living in Japan, and she is responsible for creating shift schedules for nurses at a hospital. She mentioned that the hospital manually creates shift schedules for a large number of nurses, and this process is very time-consuming. As a result, she requested an app for shift scheduling from a service provider, but they declined, stating that creating a shift scheduling app with the specific functionality the hospital desired was challenging.

The desired functionality was to ensure that individuals with less-than-ideal working relationships were not scheduled to work together at the same time. While I found the idea of implementing this feature intriguing, I also thought it would be interesting to expand on this concept. Specifically, I envisioned an application that not only implemented this feature but also divided shifts by job positions and analyzed employee experience to create the most optimal shift schedules.
